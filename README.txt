External dependencies: pygame, random

please make sure they are installed before attempting to run the code.

pip install random

This challenge took my 3 hours and 50 minutes
initially, I just made the game playable and that took about 2 hours 30 minutes, but by that time
I had so many fun ideas I kept going.

My initial thought process got me thinking about having a small grid with cells that could respond
as appropriate and keep track of themselves. I expanded from that and got my system of selecting the
desired space and it changing. Creating the easy ai came first and took about 15 minutes to write.

after creating the previously stated features and a basic welcome screen, I really wanted to see if
I could make the computer actually try to win. That took a chunk of time, especially since i accidentally
created an infinite loop and couldn't find it for the longest time. 

After that was done I tried to make it look as good as I could in the time available, finished debugging,
and made this repository then sent it in. I hope you enjoy!

also, I appologize if the instructions on getting the external library isn't actually what you meant in 
the instructions. I don't know what it means to 'package' an external library and haven't found clear 
instructions online.
